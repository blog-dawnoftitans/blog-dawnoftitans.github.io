While the scenes of mindless bloodshed had caused some to call for action, the code of the Archmages was clear; an Archmage may never play part in the trifles of other realms. In recent times, however, the Archmage Council grew increasingly concerned about the rifts in the Shattered Kingdoms, caused by the flagrant use of Nexus energies to further the Titans\u2019 thirst for power. The flight of the Apostates had also caused some concern, which grew worse when it was revealed that the Pyromancer and Venomancer Opus\u2019s had gone missing. The final straw was when news broke that the Necromancer had crossed into the Shattered Kingdoms to practise magicks forbidden by the council. With this act, they had shattered the delicate order the Archmage council had sought to preserve.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><em>At her wits end, Crystalis, foremost of the Cryomancers, stormed from the council chamber and prepared a teleportation spell. As she focused on the Shattered Kingdoms, in search of beacons of Nexus energy, a fount of desperation and distress drew her attention to the Elithen Kingdoms where a creature of corruption was causing unfathomable misery and havoc.&nbsp;<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><em>Crystalis\u2019 passage through the realms did not go unnoticed, as soon as she materialised outside the city walls the Elithen across the kingdom could feel her power resonating. Matarus, the castellan, sensing that the being was not a foe, opened the doors of the city and bade her into his Throne room. Learning more about the fate of the old Queen, and the demon Mahaha, Crystalis explained this creature had to be stopped before its manipulation of Nexus energies caused irreversible damage. With fresh optimism Matarus sent his most trusted scout, Vixia, along with Crystalis to track down the demon once and for all.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><em>While Vixia studied faded footsteps and frozen remains, Crystalis sensed veins of corrupted Nexus energies and the pair made steady progress across the tundra. After several days they arrived at the entrance of a glacial canyon. Narrow gaps in an ancient glacier showed signs of the creature, and when the wind died &#8211; one could hear the ceaseless cackles and shrieks deep within the canyon. The cackling crescendoed as the pair broke into a run, eventually stumbling into what appeared to be the inner sanctum. Bones littered the ground and the bare walls of ice reverberated with the sound of maniacal laughter.&nbsp; Vixia notched an ice arrow scanning for the foul creature when she spied a figure in shackles hanging high on the wall. Emaciated and stripped of her armour, it was the old Queen, Progenitor.&nbsp;<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><em>Vixia\u2019s cry of \u2018My Queen!\u2019 echoed through the canyon, and for a moment the cackling stopped. In the silence, the walls of the sanctum begin to crack, with fingers and hands prying them apart from within. Fallen Imperials, animated by Nexus energies began to flood into the room from all sides. Vixia fired volleys of arrows at her fallen comrades while Crystalis began an incantation. Energy flowed through the glacier itself as Crystalis\u2019 feet lifted off the ground and she hovered in the chamber. Vixia was struggling to hold the Corrupted Imperials at bay when Progenitor tried desperately to let out a warning, \u201cIt\u2019s\u2026 Above\u2026\u201d<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><em>The lurking demon clung to the highest wall and let out a roaring shriek which saw his body crackle with Nexus energy. More Corrupted Imperials flooded into the chamber, and Mahaha prepared to pounce onto Crystalis whose eyes were closed in deep focus. As he leapt, Crystalis let out a fierce cry and sent a shockwave throughout the chamber. The corrupted foes all stood frozen in their tracks, and even Mahaha himself, caught in the aura, fell frozen to the ground. Vixia notched an arrow and approached the paralysed demon &#8211; who continued to laugh through a frozen smile. As she lined up her shot, Mahaha\u2019s body crackled again with corrupted energy as a portal opened behind him. As she gazed into it she saw a faceless figure, hooded and obscured by Nexus energy drawing Mahaha away into a dark chamber of twisted creatures. Crystalis fell to her knees.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><em>\u201cIt cannot be\u2026We are already too late&#8230;\u201d<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>CRYSTALIS<\/strong> the Ice <strong>ARCHMAGE<\/strong> arrives in the Shattered Kingdoms this <strong>Thursday 8th April<\/strong>.
