We\u2019ll be offering you the opportunity to vote for the stats you think our community relic should have. In total we\u2019ll have three polls:<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Poll 1 (starts TODAY \u2013 22nd Feb)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Poll 2 (starts MONDAY \u2013 25th Feb)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Poll 3 (the winners from Poll 1 and 2 \u2013 starts WEDNESDAY \u2013 27th Feb)<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These polls will run on our Facebook and Twitter pages, so be sure to keep your eye on them! <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Phase 2 \u2013 Art (Early March)<br><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In our second phase we\u2019ll ask you to send us your artistic impressions for how you think the relic should look in game. This isn\u2019t about your artistic skill, your creativity is what counts! We\u2019ll be taking a selection of our favourite entries and putting them to a public poll to decide the winning entry, which will then be sent to our Artists to create a faithful recreation of your design!<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Phase 3 \u2013 Naming (Mid-March)<br><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In our third and final phase, we\u2019ll ask you to put the final touches to our community relic by coming up with the all-important NAME! Once again we\u2019ll take our favourites and put them to a public vote to determine the winner.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Keep an eye on our Facebook, Twitter and YouTube channels as we\u2019ll be talking more about each phase as they approach. Oh, and for those who enjoy a good set of terms &amp; conditions, we\u2019ve provided a full run down of the rules below.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>See you on the battlefield! <br><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Greetings Titans and welcome to DESIGN A RELIC!
