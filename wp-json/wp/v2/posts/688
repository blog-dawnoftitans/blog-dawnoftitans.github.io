Our Analytics team were very excited to receive this question &#8211; so here are some stats on Troop and Spell usage by players for the month of August 2020! Nergal and his mighty Mossmane skills meant Panthers were the most used Troop on attack last month. Raise Dead was the most used Spell as players levelled up their Sekhmets and destroyed their opponents with huge waves of skeletons! Looks like Meteor Strike could use a buff, perhaps\u2026<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img src=\"https:\/\/lh6.googleusercontent.com\/YNZ_zPl44NYsRasgJ0kOPDia8T02umTccSvKwVFBMQ7k9d5bfnNNl3sF84ixhepvsmXSHAXQaVcmc05ONzFbNvgC30wp_103YxIHKMMgQmq6zbUz-6l7mHe8S0ETXQCbe3AyqF0V\" alt=\"\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"\/>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong><em>Can I have more than one DoT account on a single device?<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is not advised to attempt to have more than one DoT account per device. DoT profiles are associated with Gamecenter (on iOS) and Google Play Games (on Android), and changing these accounts can cause problems. It is also advised that you make a note of your playerID in case there are issues with your account, as it will help Customer Support in attempting to retrieve your profile should it become disassociated with your device.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"\/>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong><em>Will there ever be 5* Titans?<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are currently no plans to add a higher rarity of Titan to the game.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"\/>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong><em>What is the \u2018win condition\u2019 for gaining victory in battle?<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are a number of different win conditions for battles in DoT. In Campaign levels, you are sometimes tasked with surviving a certain amount of time, or reaching a certain location on the battlefield, for example.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In PvP, the win condition is to defeat all enemy Troops, Titans, Reinforcements and Summons within the time limit.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some event types also have different win conditions, for instance, in Raid Boss, Victory is gained when the player earns any score against the Raid Boss, but the battle ends if the player\u2019s army is eliminated, or if the timer runs out.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"\/>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong><em>What\u2019s next after the War Gods?<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We are not yet ready to share details on what we have in store after the War Gods, but rest assured, we have <em>scaled <\/em>up our event plans in preparation for their launch!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"\/>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong><em>Are there plans to extend Player Level beyond 50?<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unfortunately, we investigated this earlier in the year and determined it would not be possible for us to increase the current cap on Player Level. Dependencies in the code, and limitations of our save data and profile system meant that doing so could have had drastic negative impacts on other areas of the game. We are working on ways to improve the game for elder players, and those who have reached the cap, but unfortunately, we will not be introducing new player levels beyond 50.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"\/>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong><em>The new Divine Titans aren\u2019t holding weapons in the reveal blog post, can you tell us what class they will be?<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well spotted! Both Nephilinis and Grothurn do not have weapons, so look forward to us revealing more about them in the next couple of weeks!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"\/>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong><em>Are there plans for Halloween and Anniversary events <\/em><\/strong><br><strong><em>again this year?<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have big plans for Halloween 2020 and DoT\u2019s 4th year anniversary, and we can\u2019t wait to share them with you.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"\/>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong><em>How will the new Daily Login Calendars roll out in the 1.39 update?<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once 1.39 has released fully to both platforms, players will get their new 28-day reward calendars after their current calendar has reached the end of its 28-day timeline. We implemented it this way to ensure players did not lose out on their current calendar progress before getting the new one.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"\/>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong><em>How does the rollout process of new versions work on Android?<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Google has a built-in feature that allows us to release new versions as a staged rollout to a certain number of players before fully releasing to all Android players. We utilise this system to help us identify issues and make sure new features are working as intended before reaching every player. Once we\u2019ve verified that all is working as intended, we release the update to all players across both Android and iOS.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"\/>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong><em>When the new 5* relics are added to the Divine Altar will you be combining the Norse &amp; Golden Relics into one Altar?<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>No &#8211; the Norse and Golden Relics will be available in separate Altars.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"\/>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong><em>Are there plans to upgrade the Elithen Imperial Troops further?<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We are closely monitoring the effects of the recent changes we made to the Imperial Troops, and will continue to do so for the coming weeks. If we feel the Troops need further changes, we will update you in a future blog post before we push any changes live.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"\/>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong><em>When is there going to be a Dawn of Titans movie?<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We would love to expand the Dawn of Titans universe into other media such as movies, but there are unfortunately no plans right now to make a Dawn of Titans film. Never say never, though!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"\/>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Thank you for all the questions submitted over the last few weeks &#8211; below are answers straight from the developers on your most pressing and&hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":577,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[8],"tags":[],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"https:\/\/blog-dawnoftitans.github.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/MOTD_TroopTraining.png","_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/blog-dawnoftitans.github.io\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/688"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/blog-dawnoftitans.github.io\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/blog-dawnoftitans.github.io\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/blog-dawnoftitans.github.io\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/blog-dawnoftitans.github.io\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=688"}],"version-history":[{"count":1,"href":"https:\/\/blog-dawnoftitans.github.io\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/688\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":689,"href":"https:\/\/blog-dawnoftitans.github.io\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/688\/revisions\/689"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/blog-dawnoftitans.github.io\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/577"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/blog-dawnoftitans.github.io\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=688"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/blog-dawnoftitans.github.io\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=688"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/blog-dawnoftitans.github.io\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=688"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
