To that end we will be trying out variations on the Altars going forward.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first of these changes will be to what is currently called the LVL 15-40 Titan Altar, which is priced at 8000 Gems.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The problems we are aiming to fix with this Altar include:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>The variance of the levels and rarities of the Titans from this Altar are too disparate.<\/li><li>The above problem also lead to the amount of Titan XP earned from this Altar across multiple spins also being very disparate.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>To that end, we are trying out a new Altar, the LVL 20-30 Titan Altar, which contains the following:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2* Titans<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lvl 25<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lvl 30<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>3* Titans<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lvl 20<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lvl 25<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lvl 30<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>4* Titans<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lvl 20<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lvl 25<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lvl 30<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a result of these changes, lower rarity Titans will have a higher base level. With these changes, we&#8217;re effectively increasing the average level of Titans (across rarities) that you can earn from this Altar. This results in an overall increase in the average amount of Titan XP you can acquire.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We need your feedback! This is a change we are trialing and we need \u00a0your feedback to continue making improvements going forward.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>How can I provide feedback?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As always, we\u2019d love to hear what you think about all of the changes above, so head over to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/dawnoftitansofficial\">Facebook<\/a> or <a href=\"http:\/\/www.twitter.com\/dawnoftitans\">Twitter<\/a> to let us know!<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>See you on the battlefield.<br><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Based on your feedback regarding Temple Altars, we have been looking into ways to solve issues and improve your experiences with them.
