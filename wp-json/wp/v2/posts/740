Can you explain the reasoning behind this, and whether you intend to do this for future Titans?<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>From conception, Zabava was always intended to be a powerful Titan. Our goal was to design a Titan that could take on some of the best defensive loadouts from across the game world, and players could achieve victory against these if they utilised her skills and their own Relics accordingly. Regrettably, after the community brought to our attention that the Titan seemed too overpowered, we discovered a bug that meant Zabava had higher base health and damage values than she was ever intended to. Upon careful consideration, review of player feedback, YouTube videos and comments across various chat channels, we decided these values had to be fixed and returned to their original, intended numbers. The subsequent issue with Zabava\u2019s movement speed being reduced from 27 to 18 was not intended, and has been returned to the correct value of 27 &#8211; this is now live in-game.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The bug in question, and surrounding issues to do with Titan stats and values, have now been added to our suite of testing we perform on each new and updated Titan, and we believe these new test cases will capture issues such as this in advance of them going live to players. We never intend to negatively impact Titan values after they have been obtained by players, and we will only ever do so when we feel it is paramount to keeping the game balanced and fair for our entire player base in both the short-term and long.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We understand your feedback on this issue, and a Free Gift bundle is now available in game to all players as an apology for the inconvenience and frustrations this has caused.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"\/>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong><em>Are Dragonslayer, Stormbringer and Divine Touch going to be available in events this year?<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, all three of these 5* Relics will be available in upcoming FINISH+ events before the end of the year.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"\/>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Thank you for all the questions submitted over the last few weeks &#8211; below are answers straight from the developers on your most pressing and&hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":577,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[8],"tags":[],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"https:\/\/blog-dawnoftitans.github.io\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/MOTD_TroopTraining.png","_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/blog-dawnoftitans.github.io\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/740"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/blog-dawnoftitans.github.io\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/blog-dawnoftitans.github.io\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/blog-dawnoftitans.github.io\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/blog-dawnoftitans.github.io\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=740"}],"version-history":[{"count":1,"href":"https:\/\/blog-dawnoftitans.github.io\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/740\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":741,"href":"https:\/\/blog-dawnoftitans.github.io\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/740\/revisions\/741"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/blog-dawnoftitans.github.io\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/577"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/blog-dawnoftitans.github.io\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=740"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/blog-dawnoftitans.github.io\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=740"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/blog-dawnoftitans.github.io\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=740"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
