										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>During the six years since we soft-launched Dawn of Titans, the game has been enjoyed by millions of players across the globe, with billions of battles fought with our over 200-strong line up of unique Titans and Gods.</p>



<p>Today, we’re sharing the news that we’ve made the decision to <strong>shut down the servers for Dawn of Titans on August 31st 2022</strong>.</p>



<p>It’s with a heavy heart that we cease operations on the game, and we cannot thank our incredible players enough for experiencing over half a decade of the Dawn of Titans universe alongside us.</p>



<p>In 2012, we first concepted the idea of a fully-realised 3D war simulator that would bring together on mobile devices the mechanics from the best real-time strategy games, and the visuals expected of more high-end console and PC gaming. We are monumentally grateful that so many players responded to our vision and joined us in the Shattered Kingdoms when we finally launched the game to the world back on the 8th December 2016.</p>



<p>From today, the following updates have been applied to the game:</p>



<ul><li>All In-App Purchases (IAPs) have been disabled</li><li>Temple Altar Gem costs reduced</li><li>Divine Shrine Altar costs reduced </li><li>Portal Stone Shop costs reduced </li><li>Divine Gem Conversion costs reduced</li></ul>



<p>In addition, all players will receive a free Bundle of in-game items in the next few days.</p>



<p>We want to thank you again for playing our game, and we hope &#8211; like us &#8211; the memories and connections you’ve made along the way will endure for a lifetime.</p>



<p>We hope you’ll join us on our next adventure &#8211; keep your eyes peeled for news to come &#8211; and finally, as always, <em><strong>we’ll see you on the battlefield…</strong></em></p>

<p>Please note that the <strong>information below is not final</strong>, and certain aspects may be <strong>subject to change</strong>.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<p><strong>THE DIVINE ARTHROPODS:</strong></p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><em>For millennia, in the bowels of the Archmage citadel, Sorcerers clandestinely studied the less virtuous aspects of magic. After the council forbade the use of live subjects for experimentation, many had to resort to scouring nearby woods and caves for insects and arachnids which they smuggled into the citadel in vials hidden under their cloaks.</em></p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><em>These arthropods proved valuable subjects, resilient and capable of withstanding immense magical experimentation. Fearing their own creations, some of the mages questioned whether they should entrust their specimens to the council for safe keeping, but it was already too late&#8230;</em></p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><em>As the Apostates Nephelinis and Grothurn were making their escape from the Archmage Realm they rummaged for magical artifacts in every room; and in their carelessness, they brought down a shelf with a resounding crash of glass. With Archmages now passing regularly into the Shattered Kingdoms, many opportunistic arthropods clung to the lining of robes, in search of a worthy host.</em></p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><em>Now loose within the Shattered Kingdoms, these small yet mighty specimens hold incomprehensible power for those with the will to harness them.</em></p>



<p>These immensely powerful relics will be available at an altar in the Divine Shrine for 7,000 Divine Gems starting <strong>tomorrow April 15th</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>DIVINE SHRINE UPDATE:</strong></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://blog.dawnoftitans.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/image-3233-1024x318.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1284" width="735" height="205"/></figure>



<p>Alongside the new Arthropod Relics, we’ve made some updates to the Divine Shrine Relic Altars pricing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In Monday’s blog post we announced that we hoped to fully launch the <strong>Arthropods</strong> alongside the other changes today following this post. While we are extremely excited to see them launched, we would kindly ask for your patience for one more day while we finalise testing on 1.41.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We aim to have everything live and available tomorrow, <strong>April 15th</strong>, when we will also be sharing another blog post. That blog will include the outline for Achilles’ triumphant return event, which will boast a new Synergy relic: <strong>Olympia’s Drepania</strong>.</p>



<p>SPPs can expect to have the Arthropods as well as Achilles’ new Synergy relic added to their accounts tomorrow shortly after the post goes live.</p>



<p>We know that excitement and anticipation are very high &#8211; so we’ve taken the opportunity to update the Calendar with the next 5 weeks worth of events.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>During the start of the Hachiman event, we were made aware of an issue that resulted in a number of players starting the event with scores carried over from a previous leaderboard.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Upon investigation, we determined that it would not be possible to retract these rewards, and we felt that it would be unfair to remove already-collected milestone rewards from player’s accounts as the result of the bug.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We want to thank the community for reaching out to us with this issue, and we apologise for any inconvenience caused and thank you for your patience in waiting for a resolution.</p>



<p>To compensate for this issue, we are doing a number of things over the next few days. Firstly, we’re launching a free bundle of rewards available to all players that contains:</p>



<ul><li>4* Boost Relic (<em>Forest Candle</em>)</li><li>3* Boost Relic (<em>Forest Candle</em>)</li><li>2* Boost Relic (<em>Forest Candle</em>)</li><li>1* Boost Relic (<em>Forest Candle</em>)</li><li>4* Titan XP Relic</li><li>4* Relic Shard</li><li>2x Epic Tokens</li><li>100 Portal Stones</li></ul>



<p>The Forest Candles will work as Boost Relics for the upcoming <em>Putrid Magic </em>Alliance War starting this Thursday 7th January. This bundle will be available to collect in-game within the next 24 hours.</p>



<p>In addition to this, we have made changes to the <em>Putrid Magic</em> Alliance War milestone rewards (marked in yellow):</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="461" height="969" src="https://blog.dawnoftitans.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Putrid_Rewards.png" alt="" class="wp-image-940" srcset="https://blog.dawnoftitans.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Putrid_Rewards.png 461w, https://blog.dawnoftitans.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Putrid_Rewards-143x300.png 143w" sizes="(max-width: 461px) 100vw, 461px" /></figure></div>



<p>We’ve gone through the reward track and doubled all instances of Gems and Divine Gems<strong>. </strong>The total number of Divine Gems is now <strong>1,000 </strong>and the total number of Gems is <strong>6,800.</strong></p>



<p>The Soul requirements for FINISH+ rewards have also been reduced from 25,000 to <strong>20,050 </strong>for the final reward.</p>



<p>Again, we want to thank you for your patience in waiting for this resolution and wish you all a happy new year. Stay safe, and we’ll <em>see you on the battlefield</em>!</p>

<p><strong>THE DIVINE AMBERS:</strong></p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><em>In ages past, Dragons roamed the skies, feared and worshipped by the mortals who were no match for their power. When Almarand brought calamity to the world after gaining the power of the Nexus for himself, many Dragons perished, leaving only a few remaining beneath the Cloud Veil.&nbsp;</em></p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><em>Eons later, six mighty Titans, learning of the power of the Dragons and the Nexus, combed the wasteland beneath the Veil and discovered their crystalized essence within Ambers emanating with Nexus energy.</em></p>



<p>New Divine Relics have finally arrived in Dawn of Titans! Get these immensely powerful new 5* Relics with unique Invoke abilities from the new Divine Shrine Altars starting today! As with previous Relics, these are class-based, and cannot be equipped alongside any other 5* Relic.</p>



<ul><li>Amber of Mahaha: Berserker</li><li>Amber of Gaia: Champion</li><li>Amber of Rostam: Guardian</li><li>Amber of Zabava: Infiltrator</li><li>Amber of Iyangura: Paladin</li><li>Amber of Nephelinis: Ranger/Sorcerer</li></ul>

<p>Alongside the new Amber Relics, we’ve updated the Divine Shrine Relic Altars with new drop pools and prices. Each Altar contains just a single series of 5* Relics in their drop pool (e.g. NORSE RELICS Altar only contains SVERÐ OG SKJÖLD, MJÖLNIR, AXES OF WAR, TRICKSTER&#8217;S BLADES, ASGARDIAN BLADE and BOW OF THE GODS).</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<p><strong>NEW RELIC ALTARS:</strong></p>



<p>In addition to the new Divine Altars, we’ve made some changes to the Relic Altars in the Temple that are live in the game now. Replacing the old RELIC and EPIC RELIC Altar are four new Altars with new drop pools:</p>

<p><strong>TITAN PRESTIGE HAS ARRIVED.</strong></p>



<p>In this blog post, we’ll take you through what it is, how to unlock it, and unveil a number of the enhanced skills coming to your favourite Titans!</p>



<p>As of <strong>update 1.38</strong>, a new <strong><em>Prestige Skill</em></strong> can be unlocked for <strong>every 4* Titan</strong>. Unlocking and upgrading this skill bestows powerful abilities for your max-level 4* Titans, enriching the gameplay experience, and bringing more depth and strategy to battles.</p>



<p>Accessing Titan Prestige requires the following:</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="787" height="340" src="https://blog.dawnoftitans.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Capture1-1.png" alt="" class="wp-image-467" srcset="https://blog.dawnoftitans.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Capture1-1.png 787w, https://blog.dawnoftitans.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Capture1-1-300x130.png 300w, https://blog.dawnoftitans.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Capture1-1-768x332.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 787px) 100vw, 787px" /></figure></div>



<p>Once Titan Prestige is available, it can be accessed within the <strong>HALL OF TITANS</strong>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Unlocking and <em>Enhancing</em> the Prestige Skill requires the following:</p>



<ul><li>Once a 4* Titan has <strong>reached Level 60</strong>, you will need 4* Titans of the <strong>same Element </strong>to increase your Titan’s Prestige level.</li><li>Each Prestige Level has a <strong>number of slots</strong><em> </em>that must be filled in order to progress to the next Prestige Level.</li><li>Prestige starts at Level 1, and <strong>maxes out at Level 10</strong> for all Titans.</li><li>The number of Titans required to <em>Enhance </em>through<em> </em>each Prestige level will change as the Prestige Level increases.</li></ul>



<p><strong>Tips:</strong></p>



<ul><li>Using a <strong>duplicate Titan</strong> <strong>is twice as effective</strong> as using a different 4* Titan of the same Element. Save your duplicate Titans for higher Prestige Levels, when more slots are required (i.e. Enhancing a Totec using <strong>another Totec</strong> will fill <strong>two slots</strong> when upgrading Prestige level).</li><li>It is <strong>recommended you use 4* Titans at Level 1</strong> when Enhancing your chosen Titan, as levelled 4* Titans will provide <strong>no additional benefit</strong> when doing so<em>.</em></li><li><strong>Every past, present and future 4* Titan </strong>has a Prestige Skill, so pick your Prestige Titans carefully.</li></ul>



<p><strong>Titan Prestige</strong> unlocks exciting new battle mechanics in Dawn of Titans &#8211; from boosts to base stats, new Invoke effects, Omega Troop buffs and more.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Take your best attacking Titan to a whole new level of power and decimate your opponent’s lands, or enhance your favourite defending Titans, crushing all who dare to raid your territories.</p>



<p>With Titan Prestige, many of your favourite Titans now have <strong>unique Prestige skills</strong>. Here are a few examples:</p>

<p>More Prestige Skills will be revealed in the coming days! Remember, <strong>every past, present and future 4* Titan</strong> will have a Prestige Skill!</p>



<p>Expect deep, exciting and challenging battles ahead &#8211; Titan Prestige will be available to <strong>all players on 1.38 before the end of June</strong>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Please note: whilst we roll out this feature in 1.38, you may encounter some 4* Titans that do not yet show their Prestige Skill when viewing their skills &#8211; this is intentional, and is not cause for concern &#8211; once the feature has launched for all players, <strong>all 4* Titans will have a Prestige Skill available </strong>to them.</p>



<p>Look out for in-game messaging over the coming weeks for more information and, as always, we’ll <strong><em>see you on the battlefield!</em></strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Titans!</p>



<p>Following on from Design A Relic,
we’re excited to bring you an even greater project: Design A Titan!</p>



<p>Designing a new Titan is no mean feat, and as such we’re splitting this community event into two parts:</p>



<p><strong>Stage 1 &#8211; Artistic Design &#8211; Launching now</strong>!</p>



<p><strong>Stage 2 &#8211; Gameplay Design &#8211; Coming later in the year</strong></p>



<p>In Part 1, we want you to decide
how our Titan should look by sending your artistic concepts.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This isn’t a competition reserved solely for professional artists; we welcome anyone to enter, with any artistic skill level. It&#8217;s the concept of your design that&#8217;s most important. </p>



<p>To enter, simply go to the <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1hYTKP4B66TffJL7cZyed7UEwoNPMwlR9d1szdJzT7fw/edit?usp=forms_home&amp;ths=true"><strong>entry form</strong></a> and attach your submission, along with the other information requested.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Before you get started, here are
the rules:</p>



<ul><li>Your entry must be your own original work, and must fit thematically in the Dawn of Titans universe. Your design must also be humanoid, and must fit into an existing faction and class</li><li>You may draw the Titan and its weaponry</li><li>Though we’ll do our best to remain faithful to your concept, please note we may make changes to your design during development&nbsp;</li><li>Your entry must be saved as a JPEG or PNG and submitted via our <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1hYTKP4B66TffJL7cZyed7UEwoNPMwlR9d1szdJzT7fw/edit?usp=forms_home&amp;ths=true">competition form</a> by Wednesday 7th August </li><li>Avoid animal heads or otherwise non-humanoid shapes (extra arms, legs, etc)&nbsp;</li><li>Your image must not include copyright or trademark-protected content, or content that infringes any third-party’s publicity rights</li><li>Your image must not include religious references or symbols, and must not include content that is obscene, pornographic, libelous or otherwise objectionable (including, without limitation, profanity or offensive language) as determined by Company in its sole discretion</li></ul>



<p>Once the entry period is over, a panel of judges here at NaturalMotion will create a short list of our favourites based on originality, creativity and fit to the contest theme. We’ll start a series of polls on Facebook to allow you to have the ultimate say over which Titan design should win!&nbsp; The winner will be selected based on number of votes received.</p>



<p>Later in the year we’ll open the
second stage of Design A Titan, where you’ll get to decide the skills, resist
and put the finishing touches on our Titan. We’ll then aim to run a special
Community Event in early 2020 featuring our Community Titan!&nbsp;</p>



<p><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> The Prizes</span></p>



<p><br>
<strong>1st Place</strong></p>



<ul><li>Your design will be immortalised in Dawn of Titans!</li><li>Free 4* version of your Titan when it releases</li><li>60,000 Gems</li><li>Signed Dawn of Titans poster</li></ul>



<p><strong>Runners Up</strong> <strong>/ Short Listed Finalists</strong></p>



<ul><li>Free 4* Version of the Titan when it releases</li><li>30,000 Gem</li></ul>



<p>Prizes will be delivered within 10 days of the completion of the contest.</p>



<p>The fine print:</p>



<p>By submitting your entry, you give NaturalMotion a perpetual and irrevocable (other than as provided below), worldwide, fully paid-up and royalty free, non-exclusive, license to use your entry and any modified and derivative works thereof for any purpose, including in marketing and promotions. To the extent allowed by applicable laws, you waive any moral rights you may have in any User Content (like the right to be identified as the author of the User Content or the right to object to a certain use of that User Content). You further understand and agree that your submission of an entry into the Promotion does not alter the legal rights, title, and interest in the Dawn of Titans game, all of which remain the sole and exclusive property of NaturalMotion Games Ltd.</p>



<p>As always, we’d love to hear what you think about this
Community Event, so head over to<a href="http://www.facebook.com/dawnoftitansofficial"> Facebook</a> or<a href="http://www.twitter.com/dawnoftitans"> Twitter</a> to let us know!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Based on your feedback regarding Temple Altars, we have been looking into ways to solve issues and improve your experiences with them. To that end we will be trying out variations on the Altars going forward.<br></p>



<p>The first of these changes will be to what is currently called the LVL 15-40 Titan Altar, which is priced at 8000 Gems.<br></p>



<p>The problems we are aiming to fix with this Altar include:</p>



<ul><li>The variance of the levels and rarities of the Titans from this Altar are too disparate.</li><li>The above problem also lead to the amount of Titan XP earned from this Altar across multiple spins also being very disparate.</li></ul>



<p>To that end, we are trying out a new Altar, the LVL 20-30 Titan Altar, which contains the following:</p>



<p><strong>2* Titans</strong></p>



<p>Lvl 25</p>



<p>Lvl 30</p>



<p><strong>3* Titans</strong></p>



<p>Lvl 20</p>



<p>Lvl 25</p>



<p>Lvl 30</p>



<p><strong>4* Titans</strong></p>



<p>Lvl 20</p>



<p>Lvl 25</p>



<p>Lvl 30</p>



<p>As a result of these changes, lower rarity Titans will have a higher base level. With these changes, we&#8217;re effectively increasing the average level of Titans (across rarities) that you can earn from this Altar. This results in an overall increase in the average amount of Titan XP you can acquire.<br></p>



<p>We need your feedback! This is a change we are trialing and we need  your feedback to continue making improvements going forward.<br></p>



<p><strong>How can I provide feedback?</strong></p>



<p>As always, we’d love to hear what you think about all of the changes above, so head over to <a href="http://www.facebook.com/dawnoftitansofficial">Facebook</a> or <a href="http://www.twitter.com/dawnoftitans">Twitter</a> to let us know!<br></p>



<p>See you on the battlefield.<br></p>

<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" width="480" height="270" src="https://blog.dawnoftitans.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Blog_Anti_Cheater-1.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-80" srcset="https://blog.dawnoftitans.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Blog_Anti_Cheater-1.jpg 480w, https://blog.dawnoftitans.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Blog_Anti_Cheater-1-300x169.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px" /></figure>



<p>Greetings Titans!</p>



<p>As you’ll no doubt know, we’re constantly working to improve the way we detect and take action against players who cheat, hack, or otherwise exploit the game.</p>



<p>Today we wanted to share two important steps we’ve taken over the past weeks, along with why we think they’re going to make a big difference.</p>



<p>Firstly, in the past we have issued a mix of temporary and permanent bans in Dawn of Titans depending on the circumstances surrounding the offense. However, in future, all ban for cheating, exploiting or hacking will be permanent.</p>



<p>Secondly, we’ve made changes to the way we process cheaters. Historically, because our ban process was automatic, it could only identify and ban for very clear cut cases of cheating. While this took care of the obvious cheaters, it left room for less clear cut cases to slip through the net. What’s more, for non-automatic bans, we were relying on you to assist us in identifying and reporting suspicious characters for our team to investigate.</p>



<p>We’re happy to say that we’ve now introduced a new system which helps automatically flag suspicious characters to our team. These are players that don’t make the cut for automated banning (which will continue), but are still playing outside of normal limits. With this measure in place, we hope to be able to identify and action more cases of cheating/hacking sooner.</p>



<p>There’s still more work to be done and we have lots of small changes planned over the coming months which will, collectively, make big differences to the state of the game.</p>



<p>With all that said, we still need your help! If you come across players you suspect are cheating, hacking or exploiting, let us know and we can take the necessary action.</p>



<p>Thanks to everyone who has helped us in reducing cheating in Dawn of Titan, and see you on the Battlefield!<br></p>

<p>Greetings Titans!<br></p>



<p>In Stage 1 of Design A Relic, you picked the all-important stats our new community Relic would feature.</p>



<p>Now that we have the stats, it’s time to decide how this brand new relic should look! Here’s how it works:</p>



<p><strong>Step 1: Draw your design!</strong></p>



<p><em>Here you can use any format – whether it’s a digital drawing or pencil and paper sketch, all that matters is you come</em> <em>up with a creative idea that fits in the Dawn of Titans universe. Oh, and your drawing must fit within a square canvas (no rectangle/long designs please!).</em></p>



<p><strong>Step 2: Send us your design</strong></p>



<p>Once you’ve created your artwork, visit &lt;link> and upload your image along with the other information requested. Entry will close at <strong>12:00PM GMT on Monday 11<sup>th</sup> March</strong>.</p>



<p><strong>Step 3: Short listing</strong></p>



<p>When the entry phase ends, we’ll host a series of knock-out polls on our Facebook page to decide our finalists. Our final shortlisting poll will close at <strong>12:00PM GMT on Friday 15<sup>th </sup>March</strong></p>



<p><strong>Step 4: The final decision</strong></p>



<p>As with every step of this community event, we want you to have the ultimate say. We’ll put the two most popular entries (as decided by you) to a final vote on Facebook to decide which artwork should make it into the game. The finalist poll will close on <strong>Sunday 17<sup>th</sup> March</strong> and we’ll formally announce the winner on <strong>Monday 18<sup>th</sup> March</strong>.</p>



<p><strong><em>The Prize</em></strong>s</p>



<p>As though getting your artwork immortalised forever in Dawn of Titans wasn’t enough, we’ll also be offering up the following prizes:</p>



<p>Facebook Album semi finalists: 20,000 gems and the final relic when it launches in game</p>



<p>Facebook poll finalists: 50,000 gems, the final relic, and a signed Dawn of Titans poster<br></p>
